# The problem

Event-Driven Architectures allow us to scale, be agile and keen our architecture decoupled. Ultimately I believe they help us work more efficiently.

When starting off with Event-Driven Architectures we spend time discovering our core business events, writing code to match them and maintain versions going forward.

Over a period of time more events are added to our domain, requirements change, and our architecture scales.

It can become difficult to know and understand what events are flowing within our domain.

I'm a huge fan of AWS EventBridge and I wrote this tool to help engineers gain and keep an understanding of events that flow through their domain.

# This solution

This tool uses a combination of open source tools to automatically generate documentation for engineers.

EventBridge Atlas will output static HTML, so you can host your documentation anywhere!
