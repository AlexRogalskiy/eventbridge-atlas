# The problem

Event discovery is continous and does not stop at Event storming. As organistions grow and your Event Architecture grows its important that people have access and understanding of the events within your domain.

This tool was built to help document and share schemas between people within your teams.

# This solution

This tool uses `aws-cli` and `docuowl` to automatically generate documentation for your EventBridge schemas. The tool will output static HTML that you can host anywhere.

# Getting Started

‚û°Ô∏è [Head over to the docs to get started.](https://eventbridge-atlas.netlify.app/)

# Tools

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [docuowl](https://github.com/docuowl/docuowl)
- [aws cli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
